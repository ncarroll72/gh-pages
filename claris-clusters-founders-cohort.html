It isn’t just another WordPress setup—it’s an organized framework designed to </span><strong>bring clarity and efficiency</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to law firm web presence. By structuring content around </span><strong>three core areas—Firm, Team, and Practice Areas—along with supporting elements like testimonials, case studies, and verdicts</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Claris Clusters ensures that law firm websites are easy to manage, perform well in search, and adapt as the firm grows.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built on </span><strong>WordPress + Avada</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Claris Clusters provides law firms with the tools to maintain their sites without relying on outside developers for every change. And because it’s designed with future-proofing in mind, firms can transition to </span><strong>headless WordPress or other modern architectures</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when they’re ready, ensuring long-term flexibility.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most importantly, </span><strong>Claris Clusters is free and open-source</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, built by Claris Law and designed to remain that way—ensuring that law firms always have access to a structured, scalable digital foundation without being locked into proprietary systems.</span></p><h3><strong>A New Era for Law Firms</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your firm’s digital presence is more than just a website—it’s the foundation of how you engage with clients, establish authority, and adapt to an ever-evolving legal landscape. But too many firms remain stuck, dependent on agencies that limit their flexibility and drain their budgets. It’s time for something different.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><strong>Claris Clusters Founders Cohort</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> isn’t just another website package. It’s a </span><strong>year-long journey</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designed for law firms that want to </span><strong>take control of their digital future</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">—not just with a new website, but with the knowledge and internal expertise to manage, adapt, and grow their digital presence on their own terms.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is for firms that don’t want to be trapped in outdated, rigid systems. It’s for those who see their online presence as an asset to be </span><strong>owned, cultivated, and continuously improved</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">—not something handed off to agencies with little oversight or strategic alignment.</span></p><h3><strong>The Big Shift: From Outsourcing to Ownership</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years, law firms have followed the same playbook—hire a marketing agency, outsource everything, and hope for the best. But this model is broken. It leads to websites that are difficult to update, marketing strategies that feel disconnected from the firm’s actual work, and a total reliance on external vendors for even the simplest changes.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Claris Clusters Founders Cohort flips that script. It’s about </span><strong>empowerment, flexibility, and control</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s about bringing key digital functions in-house, making them part of the firm’s DNA, and ensuring that every marketing dollar spent is an investment in something sustainable.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through this program, you’re not just getting a new website—you’re building an in-house team that can handle:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Website management</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using WordPress, Avada, and Claris Clusters.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Design and branding</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with tools like Canva and Figma.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Content creation and SEO</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that aligns with your firm’s vision.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>A unified digital strategy</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that integrates your entire team, from attorneys to marketing staff.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t about replacing agencies entirely. It’s about making sure that </span><strong>when you do work with outside partners, you do so from a position of strength.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You’ll know what you need, why you need it, and how to execute it effectively.</span></p><h3><strong>A Collaborative, Firm-Wide Approach</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A law firm’s digital presence shouldn’t be confined to a single person or department. It should be a </span><strong>firm-wide initiative</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, something that involves and reflects the contributions of attorneys, staff, and leadership alike.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why we encourage firms to dedicate at least </span><strong>three key participants</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this program—</span><strong>current employees</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who will take on these roles as </span><strong>part-time responsibilities</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least initially. These roles may grow to full-time positions as the program proves its value, with new hires filling the gaps left by advancing employees over time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">🔹 </span><strong>The Digital Admin</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The technical lead, managing the website’s structure, performance, and integrations. 🔹 </span><strong>The Design &amp; Brand Specialist</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The visual expert, ensuring brand consistency and maintaining a strong online identity. 🔹 </span><strong>The Content Lead</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – The storyteller, driving blog posts, case studies, firm updates, and other thought leadership pieces.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it doesn’t stop there. </span><strong>Everyone in the firm can be involved</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">—whether it’s writing about their practice area, sharing firm culture, or contributing to video content. The more participation, the more authentic and engaging the firm’s digital presence becomes.</span></p><h3><strong>What This Cohort Experience Feels Like</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t a dry training course. It’s a </span><strong>hands-on, immersive experience</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where your firm will actively </span><strong>build, learn, and iterate</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the course of a year.</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first three months, your new site goes live. We handle the heavy lifting, but your team is involved every step of the way.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next nine months, your team gains </span><strong>progressive mastery</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over web management, design, SEO, content marketing, and digital strategy.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of the year, your firm isn’t just self-sufficient—it’s positioned for long-term success, capable of scaling and adapting without outside dependence.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And along the way, we’ll be there to guide, support, and refine the process with you.</span></p><h3><strong>The Opportunity to Lead</strong></h3><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are opening up this </span><strong>Founders Cohort to five firms</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">—firms that see the value in taking charge of their digital future and want to be part of shaping what Claris Clusters can become.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a founding participant, you will:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get early access to Claris Clusters before its public launch.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influence the development of best practices and workflows.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Become a model for other firms looking to make the same shift.</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receive </span><strong>official recognition</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for your role in pioneering this transformation, along with our deepest thanks for contributing to the success of Claris Clusters and the broader law firm community.</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a chance to not just build a better website, but to </span><strong>lead the way in how modern law firms approach digital strategy.</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this resonates with you, if you’re ready to invest in true digital independence, then we’d love to talk.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://clarislaw.com/index.html#contact-form">Reach out today to learn more and secure one of the five exclusive Founders Cohort spots.</a></strong></p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><section class="footer-section"><h2 class="footer-heading">Let's Work Together to Transform Legal Publishing</h2><div class="footer-columns"><div class="footer-text"><p>Whether you’re a law firm marketing agency looking for powerful tools like Claris Clusters, or a legal professional ready to enhance your digital presence with Columns and publish.law, we’re here to provide the tech solutions you need to succeed.
